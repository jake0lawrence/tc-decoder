## Introduction

This project aims to create a system that:

- Aggregates content from an RSS feed.
- Publishes the content on a website using Obsidian Publish.
- Automates a weekly newsletter sent via Sendinblue.

All decisions are made to ensure cost-effectiveness and efficiency, making it ideal for a small team operating on a limited budget.

---

## Project Overview

We will:

- Use Python scripts to fetch and parse RSS feeds.
- Generate markdown files from the parsed content and add them to an Obsidian vault.
- Use Obsidian Publish to host the website.
- Automate the sending of a weekly newsletter using Sendinblue's API.
- Schedule scripts using cron jobs for automation.

## Usage

### Fetching and Parsing RSS Feeds

The script `fetch_articles.py` fetches articles from a specified RSS feed and parses them.

**Edit `fetch_articles.py` to specify your RSS feed URL:**

```python
feed_url = "https://yourrssfeedurl.com/feed/"
```

**Run the script:**

```bash
python fetch_articles.py
```

### Generating Markdown Files

The script will generate markdown files from the fetched articles and save them in a specified directory within your Obsidian vault.

**Specify the output directory in `fetch_articles.py`:**

```python
output_dir = "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault/Articles"
```

### Automating Content Updates

To automate the fetching and parsing process, schedule `fetch_articles.py` to run periodically.

**Example using cron (runs daily at 6 AM):**

```bash
0 6 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/fetch_articles.py
```

### Sending the Weekly Newsletter

The script `send_newsletter.py` compiles the top articles from the past week and sends them as a newsletter via Sendinblue.

**Configure Sendinblue API Key and Sender Details in `send_newsletter.py`:**

```python
configuration.api_key['api-key'] = os.getenv('SENDINBLUE_API_KEY')

send_smtp_email = sib_api_v3_sdk.SendSmtpEmail(
    to=[{"email": "recipient@example.com"}],  # Replace with actual recipient or list management
    sender={"name": "Your Name", "email": "your_email@example.com"},
    subject="Weekly Tech News Digest",
    html_content=content
)
```

**Run the script:**

```bash
python send_newsletter.py
```

---

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**

    Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables.

    **Example (.env file):**

    ```
    SENDINBLUE_API_KEY=your_sendinblue_api_key
    ```

    Load them in your scripts using `os.getenv('VARIABLE_NAME')`.

2. **Email Recipients**

    Update the `to` field in `send_newsletter.py` to specify your recipients.

    **Note:** For managing multiple recipients, consider integrating with Sendinblue's contact lists.

3. **Templates**

    Customize the email template in `templates/newsletter.html` to match your branding.

---

## Automation and Scheduling

Use cron jobs to automate the execution of scripts.

- **Fetch Articles Daily at 6 AM**

    ```bash
    0 6 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/fetch_articles.py
    ```

- **Send Newsletter Every Monday at 9 AM**

    ```bash
    0 9 * * MON /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/send_newsletter.py
    ```

---

## Deployment

- **Website Hosting**

    - Use Obsidian Publish to host your website.
    - After generating new markdown files, open Obsidian and publish the updates.

- **Automate Publishing (Optional)**

    - Currently, Obsidian Publish does not support automatic publishing via scripts.
    - Consider setting reminders to publish updates after scripts run.

---

## Maintenance and Monitoring

- **Logging**

    - Implement logging in your scripts to monitor activity and errors.
    - Example using Python's `logging` module.

- **Error Notifications**

    - Set up email alerts or notifications for script failures.

- **Updating Dependencies**

    - Regularly update your Python libraries to the latest versions.

- **RSS Feed Monitoring**

    - Periodically verify that your RSS feed source is active and has not changed its structure.

---

## Advanced Features

- **Personalization**

    - Collect subscriber preferences to send personalized content.

- **Analytics**

    - Integrate Google Analytics with your Obsidian Publish site.
    - Use Sendinblue's analytics tools to monitor email performance.

- **SEO Optimization**

    - Optimize your website content for search engines by using proper meta tags and headings.
