At **T&C Decoder Tool**, we believe your privacy is a fundamental right. We are committed to being as transparent as possible about how we handle your data. This policy explains, in plain language, how we use and protect your information.

## 1. Introduction

We know that trusting us with your data is a big deal. That's why we go the extra mile to make sure your information is safe, private, and used only in ways that benefit you.

## 2. The Data We Handle

### 2.1 Your Input Data

- **Documents You Upload**: The terms and conditions or other texts you choose to analyze.
- **Your Notes and Comments**: Anything you write or add while using the tool.

### 2.2 Data We Create

- **Analysis Results**: Summaries and insights our AI generates from your input.
- **General Usage Data**: Basic information about how the tool is used, without any personal details.

---

## 3. How We Handle Your Data

### 3.1 We Don't Keep Your Original Data

- **No Storage of Your Inputs**: We do not save the documents or text you upload. Once the analysis is done and you've received your results, your original data is deleted from our system.
- **Why We Do This**: This ensures that no one (not even us) can access your original documents after the analysis.

### 3.2 Secure and Private Processing

- **Encrypted Processing**: While your data is being analyzed, it's encrypted. This means it's turned into a secret code that only our system can understand.
- **No Human Access**: Our team cannot see your documents or any personal information. Everything is handled automatically by our computers.

### 3.3 Using General Information to Make Our Tool Better

#### 3.3.1 What Is Aggregate Data?

- **Aggregate Data**: This is general information about how people use our tool, without any personal details. It's like knowing that 100 people used the tool today, but not who they are or what they uploaded.

#### 3.3.2 How We Use Aggregate Data

- **Improving Our Service**: We look at patterns in how the tool is used to make it better for everyone. For example, if we see that many users are analyzing privacy policies, we might create features to help with that.
- **No Personal Details**: This data does not include any of your original text, documents, or personal notes. We can't trace it back to you or anyone else.

#### 3.3.3 Transparency in Our Practices

- **Open About Our Methods**: We want you to know exactly how we use aggregate data. We only use it to improve the tool and create a better experience for you.
- **Your Control**: If you prefer that even your aggregate data isn't used, you can let us know, and we'll exclude it.

#### 3.3.4 An Example of How It Works

Imagine that our tool notices that many users are struggling with legal jargon in terms and conditions. We might use that general information to improve our AI so it can explain legal terms more clearly. We don't need to see your specific documents to do this—just overall trends.

- **Empowering You**: We give you control over your data and are upfront about how we use it.
